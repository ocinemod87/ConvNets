# ConvNets
Different implementations of Convolutional Neural Networks I use as a blueprint for other projects and for study purposes

- Mnist_ConvNet.ipynb contains the code for a small neural network architecture which creates a model to recognize handwritten
  digits based on the famous Mnist dataset. It is well documented.
