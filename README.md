# ConvNets
Different implementations of Convolutional Neural Networks I use as a blueprint for other projects and for study purposes

- Mnist_ConvNet.ipynb contains the code for a small neural network architecture implemented in Keras which creates a model to recognize handwritten digits based on the famous Mnist dataset. It is well documented.
It reaches 99.16% of accuracy in the validation test in 40 epochs.
